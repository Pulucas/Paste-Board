# Paste Board
## How it works
Going to the website, you'll see a pretty empty page with a button. This is the homepage which i'm too lazy to make.
Going to the url with a path of "/board" and a query of "?id=someCodeHere" (or simply pressing the button on the homepage) will bring you to the Paste Board.

## What is the Paste Board?
The Paste Board is a website I made to help me transfer some text from one computer's clipboard, to another computer.
I made this because I found myself on a public school computer, and I was coding some random stuff. I wanted to transfer the code to my computer, but the only way to do that was to log into my google account, which takes time, or post it online on pastebin for everyone to see for about a minute. And I my class was starting soon.
Anyways, I made this to solve this small problem.
